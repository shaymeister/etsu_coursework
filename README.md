# Introduction    
This repository is a collection of the various projects I have and will complete
as an Honors in Discipline - Computer Science student at East Tennessee State
University.

# DecisionStructures.java
- GOAL: Practice the use of the decision structures in Java     
This program accepts three runner's names from the user and the 
time, in minutes, it took for them to finish the race. Then it will display the
name of the runner who came in first, second, and third

# IngredientAdjuster.java  
- GOAL: Experience the use of constants in Java  
It will calculate the required amount of ingredients needed to bake x number of
cookies. With x being defined by the user during the execution of the program

# Project 1
- GOAL: Evaluates the following skills:
1) Use sequential logic to write an algorithm
2) Create a simple class to do some input from the keyboard,
   output and simple calculations
3) Declare and define identifiers of primitive types
4) Use constant identifiers where appropriate
5) Request and process input from the keyboard
6) Perform basic mathematical operations
7) Display output to the monitor

# Project 2
- GOAL: test the student's ability to use the knowledge of Java that they have 
obtained up to this point in the course: input validation, decision structures,
looping structures,and random number generation.

# Project 3
- GOAL: The goal of this project is to create Tic-Tac-Toe game
The focus of the project is 
● decision structures
● looping structures
● arrays
● and methods

# Project 4
- GOAL: The goal is to change your previous, procedural implementation of tic-tac-toe in project #3
into an object oriented one.

# RomanNumerals.java  
- GOAL: Practice the use of switch statements  
The purpose this program is to accept an integer from the user and respond with
the respective roman numeral counterpart

# Test1Review.java  
Created to culminate the first five weeks of content in CSCI 1250.088
(Honors: Intro to Computer Science I)

# WordGame.java
- GOAL: Practice the use of variables inside a string
This program displays a series of sentances to the console window that contain
user defined variables.
