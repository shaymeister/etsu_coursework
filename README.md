# Introduction

This directory contains my coursework as a student at East Tennessee State University

__________

### 1250 - Introduction to Computer Science I

Introduction to all aspects of the programming and problem-solving process and the elements of good programming style. A high-level language will be used as a vehicle for introducing these concepts. Laboratory use of the computer in designing, coding, debugging, and executing programs is an integral part of the course.

__________

### 1260 - Introduction to Computer Science II

Programming in a high-level language, including programming concepts, good style, algorithms, documentation, and elementary data structures.

__________

### 4957 - Data Analytics

The purpose of this course is to introduce data acquisition, cleaning, analysis
and visualization. It exposes students to readily available and robust
state-of-the-art tools to discover trends and make informative business
decisions in the fields of finance, information sciences, marketing, healthcare,
risk management, etc. It also exposes students to the data analytics practices
implemented in the business world. No prior programming knowledge is required,
students with varying programming background, which can vary from “none” to
“proficient”, are supported via several implementation paths.  Topics include
data exploring, acquisition and preprocessing, model selection, model
evaluation, classification, clustering, and data presentation and visualization.
